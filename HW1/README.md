**1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum** \
Client diversity is important because of the following reasons,
- Security: Client diversity enhances the resilience and security of the Ethereum network. If all nodes run the same client implementation and a vulnerability or bug is discovered in that client, the entire network becomes vulnerable. However, with diverse client implementations, the impact of a bug or vulnerability is limited to a subset of nodes, reducing the risk of a widespread network failure.
- Decentralization: Having multiple independent client implementations running on different nodes ensures that no single entity or group can control the entire network making the network more robust and censorship-resistant.
- Interoperability: Different client implementations are more likely to have unique optimizations and features, but they should all adhere to the Ethereum protocol standards. This ensures better compatibility and interoperability among clients, making it easier for users and dApps to interact seamlessly across different nodes.\

**2. Where is the full Ethereum state held ?** \
The full Ethereum state is held on the Ethereum blockchain.\

**3. What is a replay attack? , which 2 pieces of information can prevent it?**\
A replay attack is a type of cybersecurity attack where a valid data transmission is fraudulently repeated or delayed. In the context of blockchain networks like Ethereum, replay attacks involve maliciously reusing a valid transaction or message on multiple chains or in different scenarios.\
To prevent replay attacks on blockchain networks, two pieces of information are commonly used:
- nonce: If a transaction with a specific nonce has already been executed, any subsequent attempts to replay it will be rejected by the network as invalid.
- Chain ID: The Chain ID allows nodes to differentiate between transactions intended for different chains and reject replayed transactions that are not valid for the current chain.

**4. In a contract, how do we know who called a view function?**\
Since view functions are executed locally on the caller's node and do not involve any transactions or state changes, there is no direct way to know who called a view function from within the contract code itself. The contract cannot access information about the external caller's identity.\
However, there are ways to indirectly infer some information about the caller:
- msg.sender: While it is not directly available in view functions if a view function is called within the context of a transaction (i.e., by another function that is not a view or pure function), the msg.sender of that transaction is available to the view function.
- Off-chain Identity: In some cases, applications that interact with smart contracts may implement off-chain identity verification mechanisms. For example, a web application may authenticate users using an external login system (e.g., OAuth), and the application can then pass the authenticated user's address as a parameter to the view function. In this way, the smart contract can indirectly know the user's identity.
